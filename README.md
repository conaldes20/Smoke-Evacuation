# Smoke Evacuation Model
This program modeled an occurrence in fire fighting called smoke evacuation. A chemical engineering principle mass balance was utilized; mass of smoke that entered a room (a)  equals mass of smoke generated in the room  (b) plus mass of smoke that leaves the room (c). In most cases, (a) is zero  and (b) equals (c), because, the whole smoke will disappear in a short while once an opening is created.
